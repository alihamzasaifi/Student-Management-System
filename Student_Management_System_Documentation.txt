Student Management System Documentation
Introduction
The Student Management System is a C-based program designed to efficiently manage student information and academic records. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to add, update, delete, and retrieve student details. The program also calculates percentages, generates performance reports, and ensures data security and persistence with file-based storage and backups.

Features
- User Authentication: Secure login to restrict access to authorized personnel.
- CRUD Operations: Add, update, delete, and view student records.
- Academic Management: Input grades for six predefined subjects, calculate percentages, and check pass/fail status.
- Reporting: Generate detailed reports for individual students or all students.
- Data Persistence: Save and load student records from files, with backup functionality.
- Search Functionality: Quickly locate students by name.
System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Compiler: GCC or any C compiler
- RAM: Minimum 512 MB
- Disk Space: At least 1 MB for storing files
File Structure
- Source Code File: `student_management.c`
- Data File: `students_data.txt` (stores student information)
- Backup File: `backup_students_data.txt` (used for data recovery)
Functionalities
User Authentication
Prompts the admin for a username and password. Predefined credentials (`admin/adminpass`) restrict access. Exits the program on failed login attempts.
Adding a Student
Inputs a student’s name, age, and gender. Automatically assigns a unique ID. Stores data in memory until saved to a file.
Updating Student Records
Allows modification of student name, age, and gender. Ensures input validation for gender (`M` or `F`).
Deleting a Student
Deletes a student by ID. Automatically shifts remaining records to maintain consistency.
Input Grades
Accepts grades for six predefined subjects. Validates marks to be within the 0-100 range.
Calculating Percentages
Computes the percentage based on the total marks across six subjects.
Generating Reports
- Detailed Report: Displays all details of a single student, including grades and percentage.
- Print All Reports: Prints reports for all students in the system.
Search Student
Locates a student by name. Displays a detailed report if the student is found.
File Handling
- Save Data: Writes all student records to `students_data.txt`.
- Load Data: Reads student records from `students_data.txt`.
- Backup Data: Creates a copy of the data file for recovery purposes.
Implementation Details
- Data Structures:
  - `struct Student`: Stores student details, grades, and percentage.
  - `students[MAX_STUDENTS]`: Array to hold student records.
- Validation:
  - Gender validation (`M` or `F`).
  - Marks range validation (0-100).
- File I/O:
  - Uses `fopen`, `fprintf`, and `fscanf` for reading and writing files.
  - Backups performed with `fread` and `fwrite`.
Flow of Execution
1. Program starts and loads saved data from `students_data.txt`.
2. User is prompted for login credentials.
3. Upon successful login, the main menu is displayed.
4. User selects a functionality:
   - Add, update, delete student records.
   - Calculate percentage or input grades.
   - Save or load data.
5. Actions are executed based on the chosen option.
6. Program terminates upon choosing the exit option, saving unsaved data.
How to Compile and Run
**Compilation:**
```bash
gcc -o student_management student_management.c
```

**Execution:**
```bash
./student_management
```
Sample Input/Output
Login
Enter username: admin
Enter password: adminpass
Login successful as Admin.
Add Student
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter age: 20
Enter gender (M/F): M
Student added successfully.
Future Enhancements
- User Roles: Add support for multiple user roles (e.g., teachers, parents).
- GUI Integration: Develop a graphical interface for easier navigation.
- Enhanced Search: Allow search by multiple criteria like ID or age.
- Grade Analysis: Provide insights such as average performance and top scorers.
Conclusion
The Student Management System is a reliable tool for managing academic records, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in educational institutions. Its modular design and robust features make it easy to use and extend.
